# Mint Mitch

This is a person website I made as a fundraiser to raise enough ETH for me to launch my own mainnet validator. This was all made with love by me, Mitch. Here you can mint iconic "Mitch Pin" NFTs, for a small fee denominated in ETH or WETH. Production contracts for minting are available on Polygon, Optimism and Gnosis Chain.

This application uses these frameworks:
- NextJS
- TailwindCSS
- Typescript
- Ethers
- wagmi
- rainbow kit

You can visit the production site at [mintmitch.xyz](https://mintmitch.xyz). 

Also, you can find me on twitter at [@divine_comedian](https://twitter.com/divine_comedian).
